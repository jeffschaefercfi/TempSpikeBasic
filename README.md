# temp_spike_match

Flutter TempSpike BLE demo App

## Getting Started

This TEmpSpike TP960 display app replaces the app provided by TempSpike. 
The current stable release is in the file app_rel001.apk

Android -only

To install, open that file on your phone. I tested with a Galaxy Z Fold 6.
You will need to allow unknown publishers to use it.

It currently displays the temperatures. More feartures coming soon, like meat specific temperature tracking.
